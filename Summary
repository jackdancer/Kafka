1. A streaming platform has three key capabilities:

   Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
   Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
   Process streams of records as they occur.

2. Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

   Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
   Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data

3. Topics and Logs

    There are different partitions in one topic.
    There are different records in one partition.

    The Kafka can store data for a long time,
    using a configurable retention period.

4. Distribution

    Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of servers for fault tolerance.
    Each partition has one server which acts as the "leader" and zero or more servers which act as "followers".
